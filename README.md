this repo builds on the small prototype here https://github.com/abbood/audioSamplingToAudioQueue

The idea is to sync the music playing on two iphones.. one acts as the host, and the other acts as a client. Most of the networking architecture was based on these awesome tutorials: <ul><li> http://www.raywenderlich.com/12910/how-to-make-a-simple-playing-card-game-with-multiplayer-and-bluetooth-part-3</li><li>http://www.cocoawithlove.com/2008/09/streaming-and-playing-live-mp3-stream.html</li><ul>

This was originally part of a iOS app that I abandoned later on. I figured I share the love with the community. If you like what you see, please vote up my answer on stack over flow: http://stackoverflow.com/a/15319705/766570
