//
// VirtualRingBuffer implements a classic ring buffer (or circular buffer), with a couple of twists.
//
// * It allows reads and writes to happen in different threads, with no explicit locking,
//   so readers and writers will never block. This is useful if either thread uses the
//   time-constraint scheduling policy, since it is bad for such threads to block for
//   indefinite amounts of time.
//   
// * It uses a virtual memory trick to allow the client to read or write using just one
//   operation, even if the data involved wraps around the end of the buffer. We allocate
//   our buffer normally, and then place a VM region immediately after it in the address
//   space which maps back to the "real" buffer. So reads and writes into both sections
//   are transparently translated into the same physical memory.
//   This makes the API much simpler to use, and saves us from doing some math to
//   calculate the wraparound points.
//   The tradeoff is that we use twice as much address space for the buffer than we would
//   otherwise.  Address space is not typically constrained for most applications, though,
//   so this isn't a big problem.
//   The idea for this trick came from <http://phil.ipal.org/freeware/vrb/> (via sweetcode.org),
//   although none of that code is used here. (We use the Mach VM API directly.)
//

// Threading note:
// It is expected that this object will be shared between exactly two threads; one will
// always read and the other will always write. In that situation, the implementation is
// thread-safe, and this object will never block or yield.
// It will also work in one thread, of course (although I don't know why you'd bother).
// However, if you have multiple reader or writer threads, all bets are off!
